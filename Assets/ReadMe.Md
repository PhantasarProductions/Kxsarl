# Assets

From this folder you can see the used assets. Please note that some assets may be missing due to copyright issues or certain files simply being too big. (Music is excluded from this repository for both reasons).
Please note that I was dependen on 3rd part assets, as the game would never be possible without all that. Yet, I did do a lot of my own. 

Now the source code is licensed under the GPL3, but my own assets (in the "Jeroen P.

# What's the deal with dir2jql.ini?

Dir2JQL is a quick tool I made to turn everything in a JQL file (JCR Quick Link). It basically fools JCR6 in thinking it has a real resource file, while JQL just links to the real files. Saves me a lot of building time and diskspace during debugging. Those jql files will not be included in the actual release of the game.
