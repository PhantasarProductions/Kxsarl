The Kxsarl
Said to be a great ruler long long ago
Under whose rule the nation of Karandonaria became the most powerful nation of the world of Xardarnor.
But that rule abrubtly came to an end.
The Kxsarl's castle now serves as a prison, but nobody knows who the inmates are or what their crimes have been.
People disappeared all over the land and people believe they ended up in that castle for the rest of their days.
The Kxsarl has become nothing more, but a myth.
Escaping the castle appears to be impossible for the castle takes an entire mountain peak and the cliffs are high and steep.
Life went on in the lands that were once the realm of Karandonaria
The mountain where the castle is, became a place most people avoided.
According to myth, the Kxarl will one day reign again.
Our story begins when an inmate of the castle of the Kxsarl awakens in one of the deepest cells of the castle's dungeons.
Completely forgotten the crime that brought this predicament.
Completely forgotten everything as the days passed by.
A name. A name is the only memory that remains.
Is there any hope for this prisoner to escape the dungeons and the castle of the Kxsarl as a whole?
