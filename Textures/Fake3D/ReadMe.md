# Fake 3D

This was a tool originally coded in BlitzMax, but when the BlitzMax compiled got busted on me, I translated it to BlitzBasic, but because my current stuff in other languages can't provide me with the routines I need for this.
Kxsarl will use faked pictures to create a 1st person effect. Due to the tile based nature of these kinds of Dungeon Crawlers that is not really a big issue. A few extra apps writen in either C# or C++ will be used to speed up the process. It's a bit of a cheesy method, but it's the result that counts.... right?
