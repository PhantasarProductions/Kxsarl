# This file was created in order to set up the spell database for

# Everything in [RECORDS] has been automatically put in by the database
# program MyData itself. All data elsewhere was manually entered.

# Please note, that basically everything is case insensitive EXCEPT the
# field names, those are case sensitive.
#
# This file is basically only for my own use, however....
# As the best way to set up a new database for MyData is by cannibalizing
# an existing project, I will allow you to use this file as a base for your
# own database under any license you wish when you remove all stuff below
# the [RECORDS] heading.
