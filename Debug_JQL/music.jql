# This file links to all raw music files that would be in the Kxsarl.music.jcr file in the final release.
# The reason why you cannot find these files in this repository is first of all to avoid copyright issues
# and second because these files are way too big for a github repository.

All this file had to do was to exist!
The game will use it to see if music is present or not.
